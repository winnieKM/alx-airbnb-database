# Index Performance Testing

## Before Indexes

- Tested query execution times for bookings by user_id, reviews by property_id, and bookings by start_date.

## After Indexes

- Noticed significant improvements in query speed.
- Indexes on foreign key columns improved join performance.
- Index on start_date enhanced date range query efficiency.
