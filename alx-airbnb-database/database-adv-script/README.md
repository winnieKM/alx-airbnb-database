# Task 0: Write Complex Queries with Joins

This task involves writing SQL queries using different types of joins to extract data from the Airbnb database schema.

## Queries Included:

- **INNER JOIN**: List of all bookings and the users who made them.
- **LEFT JOIN**: All properties with any associated reviews (or none).
- **FULL OUTER JOIN**: All users and all bookings, even if not connected.

> Note: Some databases like MySQL don't support FULL OUTER JOIN. You can simulate it using `UNION` of LEFT and RIGHT JOINs.
